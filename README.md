## Set up
1. Create a Twitter Developer Account
2. Create project and retrieve its API key, API key secret, Access token, and Access token secret
3. Install python3, tweepy, and other python libraries needed for this project under the Google Cloud SDK Shell
4. clone this github and fill in the required fields (the twitter keys)

## How it Works

The program is set to have the twitter app created execute a search query. The results of the search query are then further processed and compared to extract the tweet with the greatest number of characters in the tweet.

## Possible Future Work:
-[ ]Look into other qualities of the tweets that were queried (How long ago? How often are texted related to this query being tweeted per day?)
